 <h1>Play cipher encryption</h1>
        <h4>One of the most popular encryption models in the world, was the first cipher to encrypt pairs of letters in cryptologic history. <br> 
            <br> <q>Wheatstone</q> invented the cipher for secrecy in telegraphy, but it carries the name of his friend <q>Lord Playfair</q>. </h4>

        <h2>What is the encryption method?</h2>
        <h4>The playfair cipher requires 5*5 matrix consists with english alphabetic which equle 25 letters, but we missing out one char!!, the char that we throw out is "J", we don't need it in this encryption.</h4>
       <h2>For example:</h2>
       <h3>Let's assume that the wordkey is "mouseye" the matrix will be like this:</h3>

       <h3>The first thing we notice that is the letters of the key word are written at beginning, and "e" char has not been rewritten. <br>
       that because we need from the key word only "chars" not whole "keyword".</h3>
